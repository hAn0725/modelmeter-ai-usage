## ✨ Features

### 📊 Token Usage Tracker

See exactly how many tokens you're consuming and what it costs — per vendor, per model, per day.

- **Real-time tracking** — Automatically reads VS Code's chat session store; no manual setup required
- **GitHub Copilot AI credits** — Copilot usage is tracked in **AI credits (cr)**, matching how Copilot plans are actually billed, using real GitHub-reported credit counts when available and falling back to a model-aware estimate otherwise
- **Monthly Credit Quota** — Sign in with GitHub to resolve your Copilot plan and see credit consumption against your actual monthly allowance, with a rolling 24h / 7 day / 30 day credits breakdown
- **Rich dashboards** — Chart.js-powered overview, vendor, and model dashboards with stacked bars, donut charts, and trend lines
- **Daily / weekly / monthly views** — Switch time ranges with one click, or pick a custom "since" date
- **Status bar indicator** — Always-visible today's token count and estimated cost; hover for 24h, week, and month summaries (plus Copilot credits, if detected)
- **My Yearly Budget** — Set your own yearly budget target and see projected spend at a glance
- **Export** — Dump your usage data for external analysis

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Install the extension** from the VS Code Marketplace
2. **Open the sidebar** — Click the Copilot Alternatives icon in the Activity Bar, or run `Copilot Alternatives: Open Sidebar`
3. **Check your usage** — Run `Copilot Alternatives: Show Token Usage Dashboard` to see your token consumption and estimated costs
4. **Add a BYOK provider** — Run `Copilot Alternatives: BYOK: Add Provider` to configure your own API keys
5. **Browse sessions** — Expand the "Session Stats" section in the sidebar to review past conversations

> **Heads up:** Usage data is imported automatically from VS Code's chat session store on startup. The first load may take a moment if you have extensive history (configurable via `backfillDays`).

## 🔒 Privacy & Data

- **All data stays local** — Usage is stored in a SQLite database inside VS Code's `globalStorage` directory
- **No external network calls** — The extension reads VS Code's own session files and computes costs locally
- **No code or conversation content is uploaded** — Only token counts, model IDs, and timestamps are stored
- **No telemetry** — The extension does not phone home or report usage to any server

---

## ❓ Q&A

### Does this track GitHub Copilot usage, or only BYOK providers?

**Both.** The extension reads VS Code's own chat session store, which logs every chat interaction regardless of which provider handled it — Copilot, BYOK, or built-in models. All usage is tracked automatically.

### How accurate are the cost estimates?

Costs are estimated using **static pricing tables** bundled in the extension for popular models (GPT-4o, Claude, Gemini, DeepSeek, etc.). The extension matches your model ID to the closest known pricing entry. If an exact match isn't found, it falls back to a vendor-level average. Estimates are approximate — actual billing depends on your provider's specific pricing tier.

### How is GitHub Copilot usage tracked, since it isn't billed per-token?

GitHub Copilot plans are billed in **AI credits**, not a per-token dollar rate. The extension shows **credits (cr)** for Copilot usage instead of a `$` estimate — in the status bar, dashboards, sidebar, and session details. Real GitHub-reported credit counts are used whenever available; otherwise credits are estimated from token usage. Run `Sign in with GitHub to Detect Copilot Plan` to resolve your plan and see a Monthly Credit Quota tile showing consumption against your actual monthly allowance. This lookup is best-effort (via an undocumented internal endpoint) and may occasionally be unavailable.

Signing in only reuses (or requests) a standard GitHub authentication session to look up your plan name and monthly credit allowance — no code, chat content, or session data is ever sent as part of this lookup.

### Why don't my Copilot credits match GitHub's own usage page?

Small differences are expected: the extension estimates credits from tokens when a turn didn't report a real credit count; its 24h/7d/30d windows roll from "now" rather than resetting on your billing cycle start day; and it only sees sessions run from this machine's VS Code chat session store. Treat the extension's numbers as a local trend indicator, and GitHub's own usage page as the authoritative billing source.

### Will this slow down VS Code?

**No.** Usage data is stored in a lightweight SQLite database. The background file watcher only scans the most recent session files (configurable via `watcherWindowDays`, default 1 day). Historical backfill runs once on activation, and you can limit how far back it goes via `backfillDays` (default 60 days).

### Where is my data stored? Can I delete it?

Everything lives in a SQLite database inside VS Code's `globalStorage` directory. To reset all data, run **`Refresh Stats DB from local sessions`** from the command palette — this clears the database and reimports from disk. Note this is a full rebuild: it wipes the entire database first, then reimports only session files within your current `backfillDays` window (by file last-modified time). If you rely on older history, increase `backfillDays` before reloading.

> You normally never need to run this — the live watcher and startup backfill keep your data current automatically. Only use it if your data looks stale, missing, or out of sync.

### Do I need to configure anything?

**No — it works out of the box.** The extension auto-discovers your chat session files and starts tracking immediately. The only optional configuration is the yearly budget target and backfill preferences under `copilotAlternatives.tokenUsage.*`.

### What if my model isn't recognized?

Models are matched through a layered resolver: first by vendor prefix (e.g. `openai/gpt-4o`), then by heuristic name matching, and finally falling back to `unknown` vendor with a conservative pricing estimate. You can check how your model was resolved in the **Token Usage** output channel (View → Output → Copilot Alternatives).

### How does BYOK management relate to the built-in VS Code chat model settings?

The BYOK manager is a **visual frontend** for VS Code's `chatLanguageModels.json` file. Adding a provider here is equivalent to editing the JSON directly — both methods produce the same result. The extension simply gives you templates, form editors, and inline actions so you don't have to hand-edit JSON.

More importantly, it makes managing **multiple vendors and multiple API keys** significantly easier:
- **Multiple vendors** — Switch between DeepSeek, Mistral, OpenRouter, Alibaba, and others without digging into JSON config. Each vendor appears as a named entry you can edit or remove from the sidebar.
- **Multiple keys per vendor** — Some providers offer separate OpenAI-compatible and Anthropic-compatible endpoints under one account. The extension lets you group multiple API keys into a single provider entry, keeping things organized.
- **Auto-populated models & endpoints** — When you pick a provider template, all supported models and their API endpoint URLs are filled in automatically. You only need to paste your API key — no need to look up which model IDs or base URLs the provider supports.

### Can I export my usage data?

Yes. Run **`Export Token Usage Data`** to dump your tracking data. The exported format includes daily token counts, vendor breakdowns, and estimated costs.

### Is this extension free?

**Yes, completely free and open-source** under the MIT license. No paid features, no account required, no usage limits.

### Does the AI Tools Directory update automatically?

The directory is a **curated, bundled catalog** shipped with each extension release. It does not fetch live data from the internet. Updates to pricing, new tools, and model listings arrive with extension updates.
